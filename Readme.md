# Wind Waker Water Shader

This is a _really_ simple example of a water shader, that I've styled to look a little like the water from Wind Waker. 
It was originally written for an introduction to shader programming course that I taught to 2nd year Game Programming students. As such it's missing
more advanced options like depth fade and reflections, but for a simple, stylised scene, this is probably irrelevant. 

I've exposed all the parameters to control wave movement and the texture animation.
